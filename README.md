# 👋 Hi, I'm Nawal!

🌱 I'm currently learning to code through the FNB App Academy (Class of 2025).  
💻 I'm passionate about building my first apps and learning how to solve real-world problems with code.  
🔭 My goal is to become a confident web developer who can work on both front-end and back-end projects.  
🎯 Currently exploring HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git!
